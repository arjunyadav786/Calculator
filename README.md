Calculator by Chill-Astro : A Simple Calculator with Scripted Actions. Made for Windows 11! 

So, it's just like any other Calculator. But what makes it different is Scripted Actions! Ok what's this? Well, you give inputs on a specefic action, and get a output!
For example : Heron's Formula Page will input the sides of a triangle and give you the Area. And now this is the Start of this GUI app, and it will expand further with more actions!
Multiple Functions have been packed into a nice GUI. Available for both Windows 11 and WIndows 10.

Also it's my first time using WinAppSDK, C# and XAML and I am learning it on my own! Hope you like it. :)
